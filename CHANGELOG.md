## Changelog

### 0.10.1

- Fix editor jank and cursor jumps when editing `.blueprint` files with the experimental syntax-highlighting setting enabled: highlight decorations are no longer rebuilt on every cursor move, the highlighter no longer forces a live-preview mode switch on open, and it is now installed once as a scoped editor extension instead of restacking on every file load

### 0.10.0

- Expose a public scripting API: `plugin.api.applyToFile(file)` applies a note's blueprint headlessly (no open note required) and returns an awaitable promise
- Abort instead of overwriting when a note's content changes while its blueprint is rendering
- Expose `EnsureError` on the api object so consumers can distinguish precondition failures from render errors

### 0.9.0

- Add a `___REST___` pseudo-section for note-owned structure
- Expose the note's headings to the template context

### 0.2.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Blueprint files should now use the `.blueprint` file extension.
