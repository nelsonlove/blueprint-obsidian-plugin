 * How a blueprint file is recognised.
 *
 * Historically this was an Obsidian *extension* — `Book.blueprint`, a non-markdown
 * file the plugin registered a view for. The default is now the softer

 * note to everything else, which means no `registerExtensions` call, no custom view
 * to maintain, and a file that opens, syncs and renders like the rest of the vault.
 *
 * The consequence for the code is that recognition can no longer test
 * `file.extension`: for `Book.blueprint.md` that is `md`. Everything tests the
 * **name suffix** instead, which is correct for both styles.
